This analysis is best run using [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), which I highly recommend trying. My data analysis environment uses Python 3, with Pandas for analysis and Altair for visualization.

All files in the `raw_data` folder are from the [IPEDS Data Center](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data), under `Survey Data` > `Complete Data Files`. Beware the size of that folder; the data files in it are very large. If you don't want to download the whole shebang, you can download files and dictionaries for individual years and/or subset the data using the tools provided through that data portal.

The biggest caveat: IPEDS data collection is complicated. Don't use these numbers without reading the data dictionaries, and ask the knowledgeable folks at the Department of Education if you have questions. They know this stuff.

We used this analysis to drive reporting for the story "[Survival of the Smartest: Vermont's Colleges Must Adapt as Pool of Potential Students Declines](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/survival-of-the-smartest-vermonts-colleges-must-adapt-as-pool-of-potential-students-declines/Content?oid=19763327)," published in *Seven Days* on August 29, 2018.
